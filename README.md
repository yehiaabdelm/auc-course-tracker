I need to register a course, but don't want to keep checking self service banner. The university has an open "Dynamic Schedule" so it shouldn't be hard to run a cron job to programmatically check if a course has empty slots. After a quick chat with Seif Shalan, creator of https://gadwal.co, this should be easy. (Pushing skeleton)
